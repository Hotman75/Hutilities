## 🪟 Windows

### 🔑 Activate Windows/Office  
  You can **very** easily activate Windows and the Office Suite by opening a PowerShell and entering this command:  
  `irm https://get.activated.win/ | iex`
  > Select HWID for Windows, and Ohook for Office

### 🧩 PowerToys  
  A set of utilities to improve productivity and system management.

## ↔️ DNS

To improve speed and privacy, change your DNS provider directly from your router or system settings:

- [**Quad9 (9.9.9.9)**](https://quad9.net/service/service-addresses-and-features/) — Privacy-focused and secure (Recommended primary)
- [**Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/ip-addresses/) — Fast and privacy-first (Recommended secondary)

## 📱 Smartphone

**Android** offers the most flexibility and control — especially for power users.

### ▶️ YouTube ReVanced

You can enjoy the Premium YouTube experience for free, thanks to the **ReVanced** project.

👉 [Install Guide – YouTube ReVanced (Reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/159zbb6/guide_youtube_revanced/)

You can use ReVanced to patch other applications, but be careful with Spotify, as some users have reported that their accounts have been banned.

## 🎬 Home Cinema Setup

For streaming movies/TV shows, I recommend:

- **Stremio** + **Torrentio**  
- Combine them with a premium **debrid service** (~35$/year) for safety and quality
