# 🗒️ Tampermonkey

Directories of my Tampermonkey utility scripts.
They are made with Firefox, this is the browser I recommend to use (with uBlock Origin).

### Firefox
https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/
https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/

### Chrome
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo

To install a script, open the Tampermonkey Dashboard, go to 'Utilities' tab, paste the script URL in the 'Import from URL' field, and click on 'Install'
